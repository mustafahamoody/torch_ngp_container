## About
Docker Container of torch-ngp to fix all dependency issues. With added Python script to go straight from video to NeRF with one command.

## Container Setup and Use

First, Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mustafahamoody/torch_ngp_container
```

Change working directory to the docker folder in this repo: 
```bash
cd torch_ngp_container/docker/
```

Build and run container (detached) with correct dependencies and mounted folder for data: 
```bash 
docker compose up -d
```

Enter running container: 
```bash
docker-compose exec torch-ngp bash
``` 


## Using env_creation.py -- Inside Container

#### To create an environment for the first time (From video or photos all the way to NeRF)
```bash
python env_create.py --run
```
- You will be prompted to name the environment you want to create, select the data type and provide the path to the data
- **Videos or photos should be added to the parent folder, torch_ngp, (from your host machine) and when prompted, for the path type the file name (eg box.mp4)**



#### To create an environment from a data folder (Photos already processed through COLMAP)
```bash
python env_create.py --train
```

#### To view NeRF environment in GUI 
```bash
python env_create.py --view
```

***To visualise the created environment using the GUI you must connect your host machine display to the docker container using X11***
To Set this up run the following commands ***On your host machine:***

** For Linux Machines: **
``` bash
# 1. Install X11 Server
sudo apt-get install xorg openbox

# 2. Allow Docker to access your X server
xhost +local:docker
```
